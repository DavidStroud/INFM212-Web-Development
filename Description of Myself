My name is David Stroud, and I'm from Savannah, Ga. I'm currently enrolled at Mercer University with a concentration in Software Application Development & Human-Computer Interaction focus. This is my second semester at Mercer and my last semester as a junior. I've enjoyed my journey thus far and look forward to learning about web development/software.
